# What's the purpose ?

Having a grey background (the same as Discord) so you can have your own "dark theme" on Trello, and you're not force to ask everyone on the Trello if you can change it to this cool grey.

# How to install ?

Go to `chrome://extensions/` on Chrome, enable `Developer Mode` in the top right corner, and click on `Load unpacked extension` in the top right corner and look for this folder.

Once it's added, it's working !
